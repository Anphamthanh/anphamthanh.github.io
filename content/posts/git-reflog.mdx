Git is now a ubiquitous skill to any software engineer. To a newbie, Git flow is full of new trickeries, concepts, and gotchas. Fear not, you don't have to be a Git guru to tame Git to your workflow. My advice to move fast is NOT spending too much time to be a Git expert, but instead, read the git manual to understand the fundamentals so you can get the job done, and occasionally, get yourself out of troubles. Today, I am in big trouble.

#### The setup

* My repo has a branch namedÂ **`develop`**
* My repo also has a dir nameÂ **`deployment`**
* I am working on a branch namedÂ **`release-X`**
* On my local, I had some commits that I **haven't** pushed to GitHub
* I staged all the latest changes in the current repo, ready to commit

#### The disaster

1. I noticed that I don't want to include changes in the `deployment` dir, so I'd like to run `git reset deployment`
1. But instead, I typed, `git reset de<Tab><Enter>`, my fingers were too fast to handleÂ ðŸ˜­
1. The command above auto-completed into `git reset develop`
1. This moved my HEAD to my local develop branchÂ â†’ I **can't** get back to the tip of my local branchÂ **`release-X`**
1. To get back to where I was on my local branchÂ **`release-X`**, I need to know its commit hash which I don't

#### The rescue

Luckily,Â Git keeps a log of all ref updates, so to get the commit hashes,

```bash
git reflog
```

This will output something like,

```bash
39ab761 HEAD@{0}: reset: moving to HEAD~1
b55c098 HEAD@{1}: A very interesting commit...
...
```

Now I can simply scan the log to find the commit hash that I want to return to, and once I find it, simply run

```bash
git reset <hash>
```

And voila!, I am back with no commit lost, and all the local changes are ready to be committed again ðŸ¥°. This is a simple command, but if you don't know it, you willl have a panic attack when things hit you. And in the long run, you are likely to develop heart-related health issues if you also have fast fingers like mine.
